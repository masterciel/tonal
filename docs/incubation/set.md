# set 




## binary(set) 

Return a binary representation of the set

The binary representation of a set is a binary number in which the first
digit is always 1 (the 'P1' interval). It's important to note that
`set === intervals(binary(set))` is not always true (you loose some
information when converting to a binary set)


### Parameters

- **set** `Array` `Integer` `Binary`   - the set to get the binary from




### Returns


- `String`   the binary string representation of that set
