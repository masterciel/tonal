# Resources and inspiration

This library takes inspiration from lot of places:

- Teoria: https://github.com/saebekassebil/teoria
- Impro-Visor: https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~keller/jazz/improvisor/
- MusicKit: https://github.com/benzguo/MusicKit

## Learn

While developing, I read/study part of this resources:

The binary representation of the scales are based on the awesome book [Arpeggio & Scale Resources](https://archive.org/details/ScaleAndArpeggioResourcesAGuitarEncyclopedia) by [Rich Cochrane](http://cochranemusic.com/). Additional scale stuff (like scale spaces) are inspired by the works of [Walter Zettel](http://www.muzuu.org/new_life/pics/simpleblog/scales/scalesadvice.html) and [William Zeitler](http://www.allthescales.org/)

Trying to get the correct name of the things:
http://music.stackexchange.com/questions/17780/naming-pitch-and-interval-collections


Interval analysis stuff are based on the book [Harmonic Materials of Modern Music](https://archive.org/details/harmonicmaterial00hans) of Howard Hanson.
