# TODO

Tonal is not complete yet. Here are some stuff i'm planning to implement:

## General

- (perhaps) a smaller facade object only with pitch?
- a transpose method that works with pitchs, intervals, scales, chords and keys
- a collection function

## Pitch

## Interval

##Â Enharmonics

## Set

- Get ascending and descending sets
- Find sub and super sets

## Scale

- Better scale detection

## Chord

- Create chord inversions
- Better chord detection

## Key

- Get pitch alterations in the proper order
