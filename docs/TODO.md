# TODO

Tonal is not complete yet. Here are some stuff i'm planning to implement:

## Pitch

- toKey and fromKey functions
- fromFreq functions

## Interval

- interval/interval should accept letters as alteration
- `simplify` should have an option to create only ascending intervals (by inverting them)

## Set


## Scale

- Extract the hash lookup to utils
- Get ascending and descending scales
- Better scale detection

## Chord

- Extract the hash lookup to utils
- Create chord inversions
- Better chord detection

## Key

- Get pitch alterations in the proper order
