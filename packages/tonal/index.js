/**
 * The `tonal` module is a facade to all the rest of the modules. They are namespaced,
 * so for example to use `pc` function from `tonal-note` you have to write:
 * `tonal.note.pc`
 *
 * Some modules are NOT namespaced for developer comfort:
 *
 * - `tonal-array`: for example `tonal.map(tonal.note.pc, 'C#2')`
 * - `tonal-transpose`: for example `tonal.transpose('C', '3M')`
 * - `tonal-distance`: for example `tonal.interval('C3', 'G4')`
 *
 * It also adds a couple of function aliases:
 *
 * - `tonal.scale` is an alias for `tonal.scale.notes`
 * - `tonal.chord` is an alias for `tonal.chord.notes`
 *
 * @example
 * var tonal = require('tonal')
 * tonal.transpose(tonal.note.pc('C#2'), 'M3') // => 'E#'
 * tonal.chord('Dmaj7') // => ['D', 'F#', 'A', 'C#']
 *
 * @module tonal
