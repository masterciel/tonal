#Â tonal


## Build process

The library source code is: `tonal.md`. From that it generates `tonal.js` (es:next) and `dist/tonal.js` which is the entry point of the package.

Run test with `npm run test` (generate a new version from `tonal.md` and run tests against that)

Run docco with `npm run docs`
