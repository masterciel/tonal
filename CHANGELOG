- move json to data folders
- move rotate to collection module
- add collection/dictionary and remove _internal functions
- generate json files with arrays

[0.9.0]
- remove incubator/fifths since there is a fifths module with all this functionallity (and more)
- add pitch/enharmonics to get all enharmonics of a pitch
- pitch/props chroma property is always between 0 and 11
- Rename genericSet to toIntervals
- Rename module binary-set to binarySet
- Rename module set to pitchSet
- Chord and scale names are no longer chached
- Remove scale/parse
- Fix chord aliases
- Chord tonics can be lowercase (revert previous change) and remove chord/parse
- Rename scale/scaleNames to scale/scaleNames
- Rename chord/allChords to chord/chordNames

- _internal/coerce was returning null in some cases and throwing exceptions
in others. Now it just return null when something is not valid
- Rename scale/names to scale/allScales and chord/names to chord/allChords
- Move binary set functions to its own module

- interval/build only builds an string and renamed to interval/interval
- pitch/build only builds an string and renamed to pitch/pitch
- rename utils to internal to explicit the use case of those functions
- change pitch/pitch function signature to match the order of components in the string
- change interval/interval function signature to match the order of components in the string
- add pitch/letter and scale/triad
- don't use Uint8Array for compatibility
